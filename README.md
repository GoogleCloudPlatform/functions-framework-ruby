# Functions Framework

An open source framework for writing lightweight, portable Ruby functions that
run in a serverless environment. Functions written to this Framework will run
in many different environments, including:

 *  [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) *(coming soon)*
 *  [Cloud Run or Cloud Run for Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/run)
 *  Any other [Knative](https://github.com/knative)-based environment
 *  Your local development machine

The framework allows you to go from:

```ruby
FunctionsFramework.http do |request|
  "Hello, world!\n"
end
```

To:

```sh
curl http://my-url
# Output: Hello, world!
```

All without needing to worry about writing an HTTP server or complicated
request handling logic.

For more information about the Functions Framework, see
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework

## Features

 *  Define named functions using normal Ruby constructs.
 *  Invoke functions in response to requests.
 *  Automatically unmarshal events conforming to the
    [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) spec.
 *  Spin up a local development server for quick testing.
 *  Integrate with standard Ruby libraries such as Rack and Minitest.
 *  Portable between serverless platforms.

## Installation

Install the Functions Framework via Rubygems:

```sh
gem install functions_framework
```

Or add it to your Gemfile for installation using Bundler:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "functions_framework", "~> 0.1"
```

### Supported Ruby versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.

## Quickstart

### Running Hello World on your local machine

Create a `Gemfile` listing the Functions Framework as a dependency:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "functions_framework", "~> 0.1"
```

Create a file called `app.rb` and include the following code. This defines a
simple function called "hello".

```ruby
# app.rb
require "functions_framework"

FunctionsFramework.http("hello") do |request|
  "Hello, world!\n"
end
```

Install the bundle, and start the framework. This spins up a local web server
running your "hello" function:

```sh
bundle install
# ...installs the functions_framework gem and other dependencies
bundle exec functions-framework --target hello
# ...starts the web server in the foreground
```

In a separate shell, you can send requests to this function using curl:

```sh
curl localhost:8080
# Output: Hello, world!
```

Stop the web server with `CTRL+C`.

### Deploying a function to Google Cloud Functions

(Google Cloud Functions does not yet support the Ruby Function Framework)

### Deploying a function to Cloud Run

Create a `Dockerfile` for your function:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.6

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN gem install --no-document bundler \
    && bundle config --local frozen true \
    && bundle install

ENTRYPOINT ["bundle", "exec", "functions-framework"]
CMD ["--target", "hello"]
```

Build your function into a Docker image:

```sh
gcloud builds submit --tag=gcr.io/[YOUR-PROJECT]/hello:build-1
```

Deploy to Cloud Run:

```sh
gcloud run deploy hello --image=gcr.io/[YOUR-PROJECT]/hello:build-1 \
  --platform=managed --allow-unauthenticated --region=us-central1
```

You can use a similar approach to deploy to any other Knative-based serverless
environment.

### Responding to CloudEvents

You can also define a function that response to
[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io). The Functions Framework will handle
unmarshalling of the event data.

Change `app.rb` to read:

```ruby
# app.rb
require "functions_framework"

FunctionsFramework.event("my-handler") do |data, context|
  FunctionsFramework.logger.info "I received #{data.inspect}"
end
```

Start up the framework with this new function:

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec functions-framework --target my-handler
```

In a separate shell, you can send a CloudEvent to this function using curl:

```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8" \
     --header "CE-ID: 12345" \
     --header "CE-Source: curl" \
     --header "CE-Type: com.example.test" \
     --header "CE-Specversion: 1.0" \
     --data "Hello, world!" \
     http://localhost:8080
```

CloudEvents functions do not return meaningful results, but you will see the
log message from the web server.

### Configuring the Functions Framework

The Ruby Functions Framework recognizes the standard command line arguments to
the `functions-framework` executable. Each argument also corresponds to an
environment variable. If you specify both, the environment variable will be
ignored.

Command-line flag | Environment variable | Description
----------------- | -------------------- | -----------
`--port`          | `PORT`               | The port on which the Functions Framework listens for requests. Default: `8080`
`--target`        | `FUNCTION_TARGET`    | The name of the exported function to be invoked in response to requests. Default: `function`
`--source`        | `FUNCTION_SOURCE`    | The path to the file containing your function. Default: `app.rb` (in the current working directory)

Note: the flag `--signature-type` and corresponding environment variable
`FUNCTION_SIGNATURE_TYPE` are not used by the Ruby Function Framework, because
you specify the signature type when defining the function in the source.

The Ruby `functions-framework` executable also recognizes several additional
flags that can be used to control logging verbosity, binding, and other
parameters. For details, see the online help:

```sh
functions-framework --help
```
