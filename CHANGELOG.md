# Changelog

### v0.2.0 / 2020-06-24

Significant changes:

* Converts legacy GCF events and passes them to functions as CloudEvents.
* The executable is now named `functions-framework-ruby` to avoid collisions with functions frameworks for other languages.
* Deprecated the `event` function type. Use `cloud_event`.
* The CloudEvents implementation is now fully-featured and can encode as well as decode events.
* Wrote an expanded set of getting-started documentation.

Minor changes:

* `Testing.load_temporary` now caches loaded functions so they don't have to be reloaded for subsequent tests.
* The executable recognizes the `--signature-type` flag, and verifies that the type is correct.
* Error reporting is expanded and improved.
* Fixed a crash when a batch CloudEvent was received. (These are still not supported, and now result in a 400.)
* Renamed a few undocumented environment variables, and added support for a logging level environment variable. All CLI flags now have associated environment variables.
* Several fixes to the example code, and added a new Sinatra example.
