# Functions Framework for Ruby

The Functions Framework is an open source framework for writing lightweight,
portable Ruby functions that run in a serverless environment. Functions written
to this Framework will run in many different environments, including:

 *  [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) *(in preview)*
 *  [Cloud Run or Cloud Run for Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/run)
 *  Any other [Knative](https://github.com/knative)-based environment
 *  Your local development machine

The framework allows you to go from:

```ruby
FunctionsFramework.http("hello") do |request|
  "Hello, world!\n"
end
```

To:

```sh
curl http://my-url
# Output: Hello, world!
```

Running on a fully-managed or self-managed serverless environment, without
requiring an HTTP server or complicated request handling logic.

## Features

 *  Define named functions using normal Ruby constructs.
 *  Invoke functions in response to requests.
 *  Automatically unmarshal events conforming to the
    [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) spec.
 *  Automatically convert most legacy events from Google Cloud services such
    as Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage, to CloudEvents.
 *  Spin up a local development server for quick testing.
 *  Integrate with standard Ruby libraries such as Rack and Minitest.
 *  Portable between serverless platforms.
 *  Supports all non-end-of-life versions of Ruby.

## Supported Ruby versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.

## Quickstart

Here is how to run a Hello World function on your local machine.

Create a `Gemfile` listing the Functions Framework as a dependency:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "functions_framework", "~> 0.5"
```

Create a file called `app.rb` and include the following code. This defines a
simple function called "hello".

```ruby
# app.rb
require "functions_framework"

FunctionsFramework.http("hello") do |request|
  "Hello, world!\n"
end
```

Install the bundle, and start the framework. This spins up a local web server
running your "hello" function:

```sh
bundle install
# ...installs the functions_framework gem and other dependencies
bundle exec functions-framework-ruby --target hello
# ...starts the functions server in the foreground
```

In a separate shell, you can send requests to this function using curl:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080
# Output: Hello, world!
```

Stop the server with `CTRL+C`.
